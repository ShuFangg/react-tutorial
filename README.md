This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Other than to do list, the Tic Tac Toe and Filterable Product Table are referred from the React website (https://react.dev/learn).

## Tic Tac Toe

1. This Tic-Tac-Toe is developed based on the tutorial in https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe.
2. However, 3 features are added here to improve the game:
   - A button "Game move" is added for user to expand or close to view the game steps,
   - The "Game start" button in the "Game move" has improved with the functionality for user to restart the game.
   - For the information of the game, instead of just showing "Next player is: " and "Winner : ", I have added "Game start" to indicate the game has start and "Draw" to indicate the game is drawn.

## Filterable Product Table

1. This Filterable Product Table is developed based on the tutorial in https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react.
2. However, instead of following their code, I have developed it by myself by referring to their output and components architecture.

## To Do List

1. Please be note that user need to set up your own environment variable that include the API key and API URL.
